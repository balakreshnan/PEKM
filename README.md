Product Engineering Knowledge Mining

## Introduction
Knowledge mining is important for any engineering or design firms. The reason is there are lots of engineers who build product and they go through versions and features additions and value add. There are also lots of IP data available over time. At one point it becomes hard to know who built what which is also a reason why competing projects occur in same company.

Using knowledge mining we can provide a single view of all the engineering and other business documents to gether. Search can be in images, PDF, ppt, excel, word and others documents like forms, OCR etc.

> For example if you want to search by author or engineer name and find what all products he has worked on. Not only show them the search results but also display a graph with all his connections to products or articles are super helpful.
