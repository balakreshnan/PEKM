New York City's Build it Back Program provides reconstruction, rehabilitation, and reimbursement assistance to all Build it Back-registered residential buildings impacted by Hurricane Sandy, from single family homes to high-density multifamily housing, as well as rental assistance to displaced low-income tenants. The Federal government has allocated $4.22 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to the City, of which $2.34 billion has been allocated for housing recovery.
